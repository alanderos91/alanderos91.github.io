# About Me

I am an Assitant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucr.edu/) at [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/).
Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Department of Computational Medicine](https://compmed.ucla.edu/) at [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/), advised by [Kenneth Lange](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/kenneth-l-lange/).
My alma mater was very kind to me. I received my Ph.D. in Biomathematics at UCLA in March 2021 under the supervision of Kenneth Lange and Dr. Mary Sehl.
I also obtained a B.S. in Mathematics/Applied Science from UCLA in June 2013, with a specialization in computing.
